# BAC2

BAC 2.0 is a ground up rewrite of the BAC tool intended to unify and simplify the maintenance and use of the tool, and provide a platform on which new functionality can built. 

Key points: 
* Developed in Python
* Python API encapsulates core functionality
* Python API codes wrap around other libraries and services, e.g. Radical CyberTools
* Command line user interface wraps around API
* Commands take the form bac build [options]
